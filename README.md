## Getting started

`npm install`

`npm start`

This app is designed to be hosted and developed in the cloud by a service such as plunkr
or HackerRank. As such, all required runtime libraries are included via CDNs and all transpilation and compilation happens in the browser on the fly.

In order to get started locally, simply type `npm start` at the command line, or
launch your static file server of choice and browse to `index.html`.

**Remember**:
* There is no need to transpile typescript, it will be transpiled in the browser.
* Make all edits within the `solution/` folder only. Do not alter the rest of the
files or folders.
